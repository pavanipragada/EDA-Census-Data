# Overview
* This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a small dataset containing population data of 50 US states and 2 territories (District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) for the years 2010-2019.
* The dataset is stored in the file census_statespop.csv, which is included in the repository.
* The main objectives of this analysis are to demonstrate how to use Pandas for data pre-processing, manipulation, and munging.
* The dataset has some quirks, such as missing values in rows, columns, and duplicates, which will be addressed during the analysis.
* Additionally, the dataset includes a column titled 'Region' indicating whether the state belongs to one of four census regions â€“ Northeast, South, Midwest, and West.
